Hi,

Thank you for the opportunity to take part in the selection process. It was a valuable experience, and I genuinely appreciate your time and consideration.

1. I added a Postman collection to help with visualization.

2. In the first place, recommend executing, to create a JWT token for the subsequent calls
```
http://localhost:8080/authenticate
```

3. For your convenience, I have enabled the endpoint:
```
http://localhost:8080/swagger/swagger-ui/index.html
```

I am open to answering any question

Best regards,
